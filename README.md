## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust (latest stable version recommended)
- `cargo` (Rust's package manager)

### Building and Running

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    \`\`\`bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/neoterm.git
    cd neoterm
    \`\`\`

2.  **Set up OpenAI API Key (for AI features):**
    NeoTerm uses the OpenAI API for its AI capabilities. You'll need to set your API key as an environment variable:
    \`\`\`bash
    export OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"
    \`\`\`
    Replace `"YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"` with your actual OpenAI API key.

3.  **Run the application:**
    \`\`\`bash
    cargo run
    \`\`\`

This will compile and run the NeoTerm application.

## Usage

- **Command Input**: Type commands in the input bar at the bottom and press Enter.
- **History Navigation**: Use `Up` and `Down` arrow keys to navigate through command history.
- **Autocomplete**: Press `Tab` to cycle through command suggestions.
- **AI Commands**: Type `#` or `/ai` followed by your query to ask the AI for assistance (e.g., `# how to list files in a directory`).
- **Toggle AI Agent**: Click the "ü§ñ Agent ON/OFF" button in the toolbar to enable/disable the AI conversational agent.
- **Settings**: Click the "‚öôÔ∏è Settings" button to open the settings panel.
