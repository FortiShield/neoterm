# NeoTerm TODO List

This document outlines immediate and future tasks for NeoTerm development.

## High Priority

- [ ] **Refine AI Streaming**: Ensure smooth, real-time streaming of AI responses to the UI.
- [ ] **Contextual AI**: Implement sending relevant block content (selected block, previous command/output) as context to the AI.
- [ ] **AI-driven Command Generation**: Allow AI to suggest executable commands that can be easily inserted into the input bar.
- [ ] **Tool Integration**: Enable AI to use internal tools (e.g., `read_file`, `list_dir`) to gather information or perform actions.
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Improve robust error handling and user feedback for PTY, API, and AI interactions.
- [ ] **Clipboard Integration**: Implement copy functionality for command input and output blocks.

## Medium Priority

- [ ] **Theme Editor UI**: Build a comprehensive UI for live theme editing (colors, fonts).
- [ ] **Keybinding Editor UI**: Create a UI for customizing keyboard shortcuts.
- [ ] **Environment Profile Management**: UI for adding, editing, and deleting environment profiles.
- [ ] **Command Palette Enhancements**: Add more commands, fuzzy search improvements, and better visual feedback.
- [ ] **Block Actions**: Implement "Export" and "Bookmark" actions for blocks.
- [ ] **Performance Benchmarks**: Implement and integrate the performance benchmarking tools.

## Low Priority / Future Phases

- [ ] **WebSocket Server**: Develop the backend for real-time collaboration.
- [ ] **Session Sharing UI**: Build the frontend for sharing terminal sessions.
- [ ] **Cloud Sync**: Implement synchronization of settings, history, and workflows.
- [ ] **Plugin System**: Develop the core plugin API and WASM/Lua runtime integration.
- [ ] **Plugin Marketplace UI**: Design and implement the UI for browsing and installing plugins.
- [ ] **Distribution Packages**: Create installers/packages for Linux (AppImage, Deb), macOS, and Windows.
- [ ] **Ollama CLI Integration**: Integrate with local LLM inference via Ollama.
- [ ] **Mouse/Keyboard Selection**: Implement advanced text selection within blocks.
- [ ] **Workflow Debugger**: Develop a visual debugger for complex workflows.
- [ ] **Virtual File System**: Implement a sandboxed file system.
- [ ] **Natural Language Detection**: For better AI processing.
- [ ] **GraphQL Integration**: If a backend uses GraphQL.
- [ ] **LPC (Language Processing Core)**: Dedicated module for advanced language processing.
- [ ] **MCQ (Multi-Choice Questions)**: For interactive learning.
- [ ] **Markdown Parser**: Render rich Markdown content directly in blocks.
- [ ] **Drive Management**: Integration with file system drives.
- [ ] **Fuzzy Matching**: Enhance fuzzy matching for all search/autocomplete.
- [ ] **Asset Macro**: For embedding binary assets.
- [ ] **WebAssembly Serving**: For web-based components or plugins.
- [ ] **Watcher**: File system watcher for live updates.
